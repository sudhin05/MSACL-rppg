  # Multi-Scale Attention and Cross Spatial Learning Based Remote Photoplethysmography(rPPG)

• A novel multi-scale attention & cross-spatial learning approach for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
signal extraction from facial videos, achieving a 12.22% improvement in SNR and a 26.74% reduction in MSE
compared to state-of-the art methods
• The algorithm fuses spatial and temporal information from multiple scales, effectively mitigating the impact of
noise and motion blur on signal quality in challenging outdoor scenarios with standoff distances of 1.5-3 metres
